/*
You are a new developer at a tech company, and you have just realized you've accidentally left typos in all of the company's data! 

Write some code that takes the array provided to you below. Notice that the array is an array of objects, where each object is a "chunk" of code containing a typo. Using the appropriate array looping method, write a callback function for that array looping method that will remove the "typo" key-value pair from each object. 

If you do everything correctly, the console.log at the bottom of this file should print the data set with all typos removed to the console.
