/*
Hey developers. Remember that nerd coder from the first problem? Well I'm her, but they call me the Anti-Elle. I have a master plan to infect all her code with not one, but TWO typos, and all with one single algorithm!! *evil laughter*

Using the appropriate array looping method, write some code that takes in an array of objects, where each object represents a chunk of code. A sample array is provided below.

Your code should add two key-value pairs to each object in the array. The first key-value pair will have a key called "typoOne" (feel free to give it any typo value you like), and the second key-value pair will have a key called "typoTwo" (with any value). 

If you do everything right, the console.log at the bottom of this file should show two typo key-value pairs in each object in the array.

let ellesCode = [
    {
        actualCode: "function theFunction..."
    },
    {
        actualCode: "if (valueA == valueB)..."
    },
    {
        actualCode: "const randomNum =..."
    }
]

// Write your code below:






// Write your code above

console.log(ellesCode)
